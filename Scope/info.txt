In this we will learn about Scope:
Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code:
4 Scopes in JavaScript
: Function Scope
: Block Scope
: Global Scope
: Lexical Scope

1 - Function Scope:
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
eg 
It will give error as sum can only be accessed within the function;
function calSum(a, b){
    let sum = a+b;
    //console.log(sum);
}

calSum(2,5);             
console.log(sum);
